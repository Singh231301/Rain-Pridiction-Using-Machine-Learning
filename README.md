# Rain-Prediction-Model

This Github repository will give you full demonstration rain prediction through machine learning, employing a multiple linear regression approach with temperature, humidity, and light intensity as predictive attributes. Ardruino uno interfacing of sensors, including DHT11 for temperature and humidity measurements and LDR for light intensity is done , to gather real-time data for analysis and prediction and model is developed on Raspberry Pi 4.

**Steps to Rum the model**
1. Setup the Raspberry pi and install all files OR you can use .ipynb file
2. Get all required Coefficient and Intercept through the model
3. Connect all sensors and Arduino as shown in below circuit diagram
4. Enter the coeddicent and Intercept into the arduino(.ino) file
5. Upload the code to Arduino and you will see the Rain prediction on the serial monitor in arduino. 

Ps: Kindly check and callibrate your senors before running model, for that you may gothrough the respective sensor interfacing folder. 
 
The circuit to be implemented can be refered as follows:
